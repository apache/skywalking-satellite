// 1. The Collector plugin would fetch or receive the input data.
// 2. The Parser plugin would parse the input data to SerializableEvent that is supported
//    to be stored in Queue.
// 3. The Queue plugin stores the SerializableEvent. However, whether serializing depends on
//    the Queue implements. For example, the serialization is unnecessary when using a Memory
//    Queue. Once an event is pulled by the consumer of Queue, the event will be processed by
//    the filters in Processor.
// 4. The Filter plugin would process the event to create a new event. Next, the event is passed
//    to the next filter to do the same things until the whole filters are performed. All created
//    events would be stored in the OutputEventContext. However, only the events labeled with
//    RemoteEvent type would be forwarded by Forwarder.
// 5. After processing, the events in OutputEventContext would be stored in the BatchBuffer. When
//    the timer is triggered or the capacity limit is reached, the events in BatchBuffer would be
//    partitioned by EventType and sent to the different Forwarders, such as Segment Forwarder and
//    Meter Forwarder.
// 6. The Follower in different Senders would share with the remote client to avoid make duplicate
//    connections and have the same Fallbacker(FallBack strategy) to process data. When all
//    forwarders send success or process success in Fallbacker, the dispatcher would also ack the
//    batch is a success.

//
// There are four stages in the lifecycle of Satellite plugins, which are the initial phase,
// preparing phase, running phase, and closing phase. In the running phase, each plugin has
// its own interface definition. However, the other three phases have to be defined uniformly.

type Plugin interface {
	// Description returns the description of the specific plugin.
	Description() string
	// Init initialize the specific plugin.
	InitPlugin(config map[string]interface{})
